			<p>In the access or use of the Site, you shall comply with these Terms and the special
			
			warnings or instructions for access or use posted on the Site. You may not make any
			
			change or alteration to the Site or any Content or services that may appear on this Site
			
			and may not impair in any way the integrity or operation of the Site. Without limiting
			
			the generality of any other provision of these Terms, if you default negligently or
			
			willfully in any of the obligations set forth in these Terms (including our Privacy
			
			Policy), you shall be liable for all the losses and damages that this may cause to
			
			EkooEdu, our affiliates, partners or licensors.</p><br/>
			
			<p><b>2. Your Privacy</b></p>
			
			<p>Your privacy and that of others is very important to us. Please review our Privacy
			
			Policy, which also governs your visit to the Site, so that you may understand our
			
			privacy practices.</p><br>
			
			<p><b>3. Your Account</b></p>
			
			<p>You may choose to register at our Site. If you do, you will have a login name and
			
			password for your account and for each relevant section of the Site. You are
			
			responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account, login name and
			
			password and for restricting access to your computer. You agree to accept
			
			responsibility for all activities that occur under your account, login name and/or
			
			password. You agree to provide only accurate, truthful information. We reserve the
			
			right to refuse service and/or terminate accounts without prior notice if you violate
			
			these Terms or if we decide, in our sole discretion, that it would be in EkooEdu’s best
			
			interests to do so.</p>
			
			<p>You may cancel your EkooEdu account at any time; however, there are no refunds for
			
			cancellation. Fully permitted by law, refunds (if any) are at our discretion and only in
			
			the form of credit for our Services. In the event that EkooEdu suspends or terminates
			
			your account or these Terms, you understand and agree that you shall receive no
			
			refund or exchange for any unused time on a subscription, any license or subscription
			
			fees for any portion of the Service, any content or data associated with your account,
			
			or for anything else. Any outstanding balance on your account becomes immediately
			
			due and payable upon termination of these Terms for any reason.</p>
			
			<p>Coaching sessions can be freely rescheduled, or cancelled and refunded provided the
			
			rescheduling or cancellation takes place at least 24 hours prior to the planned starting
			
			time of the session. No session can be cancelled and / or refunded later than 24 hours
			
			before its planned starting time ; in particular a session will not be refunded if it is
			
			missed for whatever reason and not cancelled at least 24 hours before its planned
			
			starting time.</p><br/>
			
			<p><b>4. Services and Accuracy of Information</b></p>
			
			<p>We attempt to be as accurate as possible when describing our Services on the Site;
			
			however, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we do not warrant that the product
			
			descriptions, or other content available on the Site are accurate, complete, reliable,
			
			current, or error-free.</p>
			
			<p>We also attempt to be as accurate as possible when describing our special conditions
			
			for selected Promotion Campaigns on the Site; however, we shall be entitled to
			
			modify the complimentary products or the general terms and conditions at any time
			
			during the Promotion by publishing any such modifications on the website.</p>
			
			<p>The products and services available on the Site are for personal use only. You may
			
			not sell or resell any of the products or services you purchase or otherwise received
			
			from us. We reserve the right, with or without notice, to cancel or reduce the quantity
			
			of any orders that we believe, in our sole discretion, may result in the violation of our
			
			Terms. Customers below the age of 21 are to seek parental consent prior to making
			
			any online purchases.</p><br>

			exploited, in whole or in part, for any purpose without our prior written consent. Blog
			
			posts may be used and referred to when their origin is explicitly mentioned.
			
			Session content and video recordings are part of the Content, and as such are the
			
			property of EkooEdu, our affiliates, partners or licensors, and is protected by
			
			Singapore and international copyright laws. The video recordings of a User may be
			
			made available to that User or group of Users featuring on the recording, while the

			any of its content containing video recording of its Users without their explicit
			
			consent or the explicit consent of their parents or legal representative.</p>
			
			<p>You may have the opportunity to post information and content on the Service. Any
			
			content a User submits, posts, displays, or otherwise makes available on the Service,
			
			which originates from a particular User, including all intellectual property rights
			
			therein, is referred to as that User’s “User Content.” You grant us a perpetual, non-
			
			exclusive, fully paid, royalty-free, irrevocable, sub-licensable, worldwide license and
			
			right to display, use, perform, reproduce, modify, distribute and create derivative
			
			works of all such User Content in whole or in part, in any media, software, or

			connection with the Service and EkooEdu’s (and its successors’ and affiliates’)
			
			business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of
			
			the Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any
			
			media channels.</p>
			
			<p>By posting or providing any user content, you represent and warrant that public
			
			posting and use of your user content by us will not infringe upon or violate the rights
			
			of any third party, including without any limitation any intellectual property rights,
			
			rights of publicity or rights of privacy.</p><br>
			
			<p><b>7. Special Provision Specific to Coaching</b></p>
			
			<p>No coaching relationship started through EkooEdu may continue outside of EkooEdu
			
			before at least one year has elapsed after (1) the last coaching session with that family
			
			on EkooEdu, and (2) the Coach has notified EkooEdu in writing that they were
			
			putting an end to the contract. Neither Coaches nor Parents are allowed to suggest
			
			meeting offline or using another website distinct from EkooEdu. Neither Coaches nor
			
			Parents are allowed to solicit personal information about a Parent or a Coach. Further,
			
			you agree to report any violations or breaches of this clause immediately by
			
			contacting us by email at info@@ekooedu.com.</p>
			
			<p>Session videos will be recorded and made available by EkooEdu to Parents for a
			
			given period of time. Coaches agree that the recordings of videos in which they are
			
			featured may be shared with the parents at any time. They also agree that subject to
			
			their prior consent, the videos will be used by EkooEdu for any other purpose, free of
			
			any condition or obligation whatsoever. Coaches should never publish or use a video
			
			without the explicit consent of both Parents and EkooEdu.</p>
			
			<p>Coaches must bring the material in addition to resources provided by EkooEdu.</p><br/>
			
			<p><b>8. Special provision specific to community areas, games, coaching content</b></p>
			
			<p>EkooEdu offers specific areas in which members of the EkooEdu community may
			
			communicate freely (e.g. messaging services, chat, wall, etc.). EkooEdu acts
			
			exclusively as a host of the community areas made available and our responsibility is
			
			therefore that of a technical supplier. Parents and teachers are therefore asked to
			
			monitor the use of our community areas by their children/pupils.</p>
			
			<p>You acknowledge that you are fully responsible for any Contributions published by
			
			your children on the Site and that those Contributions do not form part of the editorial
			
			activity undertaken by EkooEdu. As a result, EkooEdu may not be held liable for the
			
			unlawful nature of any Contributions submitted. You guarantee EkooEdu against any
			
			form of recourse and/or legal action initiated against any other person as a result of
			
			the publication of Contributions on the Site. You will pay any charges, payments and
			
			compensation that may be due to or claimed by such persons for whatever reason.
			
			The messaging services, chat, wall, comments section and other community areas are
			
			intended for the exchange and discussion of content that must abide with clause 5
			
			(Conduct and Safety). Any Contributions not complying with this clause may be
			
			deleted by the site moderator and may even be notified to the authorities.</p><br/>
